# Slurm Charms
This is the home of the slurm charms.

## Build
To build all of the slurm charms, from the root of this project run, `make charms`.
The successfull execution of this command will produce built `.charm` files for each charm contained in this repo, and place them in the `out/` directory.
```bash
$ make charms
```
## Deployment
The `make deploy-*` commands included in the makefile can be used to deploy the bundles contained in the `bundles/` directory. 

## Slurm Configuration

To deploy slurm with multiple partions you need to set the partition config value for the slurmd node on deployment.

```bash
juju deploy ./slurmd.charm p1 --config partion-name="partition1"
juju deploy ./slurmd.charm p2 --config partion-name="partiotion2"
```
This will deploy 2 units, p1 and p2, both of which are in a seperate partition.

To specify cluster name:
```bash
juju deploy ./slurm-configurator.charm --config cluster_name="mycluster"
```

### Custom Configurations
Our goal is to give the user as much freedom as possible in the configuartion of your cluster. To add your own config options to slurm.conf, supply a string of the values you want to be populated in slurm.conf

config values can be found at https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html

```bash
juju deploy ./slurm-configurator --config custom_config="your=keyvalue/pairs"
```
